When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless skies, my love
To the dark and the endless skies
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command, my love
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth
And last 'til the end of time my love
And it would last 'til the end of time
The first time ever I saw your face
Your face, your face, your face
Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?
Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were
You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me
Now can't you see?
(I love you) ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me
Now can't you see?
What's wrong with that?
I need to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you
I love you
Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, love isn't silly
Love isn't silly at all (yeah, yeah)
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
(I love you) how can I tell you about my loved one?
(I love you) how can I tell you about my loved one?
I love you
I love you
I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, say, can't you see?)
I love you (ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say, can't you see?)
I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, say, can't you see?)
(How can I tell you about my loved one?)
I love you (ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say, can't you see?)
(How can I tell you about my loved one?)
I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, say, can't you see?)
(How can I tell you about my loved one?)
I love you (ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say, can't you see?)
(How can I tell you about my loved one?)
You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
But look around me and I see it isn't so, oh no
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
ou got me looking at that heaven in your eyes
I was chasing your direction
I was telling you no lies
And I was loving you
When the words are said, baby, I lose my head
And in a world of people, there's only you and I
There ain't nothing come between us in the end
How can I hold you when you ain't even mine
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more
All that I need is just one moment in your arms
I was chasing your affection
I was doing you no harm
And I was loving you
Make it shine, make it rain, baby I know my way
I need that sweet sensation of living in your love
I can't breath when you're away, it pulls me down
You are the question and the answer am I
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more
And in this world of people there's only you and I
There ain't nothing come between us in the end
Ah, can I hold you when you ain't even mine
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

I'm saying all the things that I know you'll like
Making good conversation
I got a handle you just right
You know what I mean
I took you to an intimate restaurant
Then to a suggestive movie
There's nothing left to talk about
'Less it's horizontally

Let's get physical, physical
I want to get physical
Let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk

Let's get physical, physical
I want to get physical
Let's get into physical

Let me hear your body talk

I've been patient, I've been good
Tried to keep my hands on the table
It's gettin' hard this holdin' back
You know what I mean

I'm sure you'll understand my point of view
We know each other mentally
You gotta know that you're bringin' out
The animal in me

Let's get physical, physical

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?
Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (she's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride
How could you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (she's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold (you know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother (maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (she's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream, why)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
When doves cry (doves cry, doves cry)
When doves cry (doves cry, doves cry)
Don't cry (don't cry)
And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you
And if I should ever go away
Well, then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember
Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for
Well, you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you
Oh and then for the times when we're apart
Well, then close your eyes and know
These words are coming from my heart
And then if you can remember
Oh, keep smilin' and keep shinin'
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
In good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
Oh, that's what friends are for
Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for
Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
'Cause I tell you that's what friends are for
For good times and for bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for (that's what friends are for, ya)
On me for sure (count on me for sure, count on me for sure)
That's what friends are for
Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you, oh
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I play them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well, it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door
'Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, f-
I got to have faith, faith, faith
Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say, "Please, please, please don't go away"
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe, huh, you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, oh baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for somethin' more
Yes, I gotta have faith
Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I'll just have to wait
Because I've got to have faith
I gotta have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor (I just got to have faith)
Oh, oh baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for somethin' more
'Cause I gotta have faith
Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
 know this pain (I know this pain)
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains? (these chains)
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind (mmm)
Is it really fair to feel, this way inside? (woah)
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you going to let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know, things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold... on for one more day
Can you hold... on for one more day?
Things'll go your way...
Hold on for one more day
You could sustain (you could sustain)
Or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness (no, baby)
You got yourself into your own mess (oooh...)
Lettin' your worries pass you by (lettin' your worries pass you by)
Baby, don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind? (no, no)
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you going to let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know, things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold... on for one more day
Can you hold... on for one more day?
Things'll go your way (oh, things'll go your way)
Hold on for one more day
I know that there is pain, but you
Hold on for one more day, and ya
Break free from the chains...
Yeah I know that there is pain, but you
Hold for one more day, and ya
Break free, break from the chains
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye (and say goodbye)
Until then, baby, are you going to let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know, things can change (know)
Things'll go your way
If you hold... on for one more day, yeah
Can you hold... on...
Don't you know, things could change
Things could go your way
If you hold... on for one more day
Can you hold... on
Can you hold on
Mmm, can you hold on, baby
Won't you tell me know
Hold on for one more day, cause
It's gonna go your way
Don't you know, things could change
Things could go your way
If you hold on for one more day, yeah
Can't you change it this time
Make up your mind
Hold on, hold on
Baby hold on
Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you
To be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby
You just wait
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?
When I can't sleep at night
Without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try
I just break down and cry
Pain in my head
Oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever
You and I
Will you love me again
Like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead
Just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let go
Although we've come
To the end of the road (end of the the road)
Still I can't let go (the end of the road and I can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you (I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Still I can't let go ('cause I know I've come to the end of the road)
It's unnatural (oh my god, oh my god, help me out a little bit, baby)
You belong to me
I belong to you
Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out there and cheat at night (maybe I'll forgive you)
Just like you did baby, but that's alright
I love you anyway (maybe you will try)
And I'm still going to be here for you until my dying day, baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby (we should be happy together forever)
'Cause you just won't come back to me, will you? (You and I)
Just come back to me
Yes baby, my heart is lonely (lonely, lonely)
My heart hurts baby, yes, I feel pain too (lonely, lonely)
Baby, please
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let go
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Ram-pa-ram, oh, yeah
I got a new life, you would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad, how can a person like me care for you?
(Ah) why do I bother, when you're not the one for me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, is enough enough?
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong?
under the pale moon, for so many years I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon, where I see a lot of stars
Ooh-ooh-ooh, is enough enough?
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
And no one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong? Oh, oh, oh
I saw the sign, and it opened up my mind
And I am happy now, living without you
I've left you, oh, oh, oh
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
I saw the sign
(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)
(I saw the sign, I saw the sign) I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
